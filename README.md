A simple implementation of chess


# TODO

- [ ] Add heuristic to the alpha beta search.
- [ ] Speed up simulations.
- [ ] Agent should only search promising paths.
- [ ] Agent should search a fixed number of nodes as opposed to being limited by depth.
- [ ] Add support for castling.
- [x] Create a test for random errors. E.g. play 50 random games and test if any errors are raised (should not be the case).
